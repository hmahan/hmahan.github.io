Hello my name is Hailey and I have a lot of feelings about things. This is where I write about said things. Topics include (but are not limited to):

- Code, particularly code in the Front-end realm
- Tech industry
- Music
- Old movies
- Television
- Food
- Alcohol
- Feminism

I live in Nashville, Tennessee and work as a Front-end Developer at [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com) where I don't get to travel but I get to work on cool things that help other people travel and look at beautiful travel pictures all day. 

More to follow.
