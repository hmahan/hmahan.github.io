Classical music gets a bad rap. It's usually looked at as uptight and incredibly boring. But really good classical music is anything but. Breathtaking and moving, classical music might become your new favorite genre. 

Not only is it interesting, but it is the basis of every other genre on music out there. An understanding of classical music will give you a greater appreciation of everything from Jay-Z to Radiohead to Beyonce. Here are three (living) classical music composers to check out for beginners. 

### Christopher O'Riley

When someone asks me what to listen to to get into classical music I always point them to [Christopher O'Riley](http://www.rdio.com/artist/Christopher_O%27Riley/) first. His main deal are these beautiful piano covers of Radiohead songs along with some Nirvana and Nick Cave. If you are an NPR fan you might know him as the host of [From the Top](http://www.fromthetop.org/).

You really can't go wrong with any of his albums, but I have always loved [Hold Me to This](http://www.rdio.com/artist/Christopher_O%27Riley/album/Hold_Me_to_This_-_Christopher_O%27Riley_Plays_Radiohead_1/). But if you aren't ready for the commitment of favoriting him on Rdio [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TagBFTSt0wE) is a video of him playing his cover of Radiohead's "Karma Police."

### Max Richter

Max Richter is up there as one of the best musicians of our time and outside of the classical music scene, he isn't well known. Stop what you are doing and listen to [Memoryhouse](http://www.rdio.com/artist/Max_Richter/album/Memoryhouse/) right now. The "documentary music" album is so stunning it will make you cry, mixing ambient sounds, poetry readings, voices and music that explores different story lines.

[Recomposed by Max Richter - Vivaldi The Four Seasons](http://www.rdio.com/artist/Max_Richter%2C_Daniel_Hope%2C_Konzerthaus_Kammerorchester_Berlin%2C_Andr%C3%A9_de_Ridder/album/Recomposed_By_Max_Richter_Vivaldi%2C_The_Four_Seasons/) takes one of the most well-known pieces of classical music, Vivaldi's Four Seasons, and deconstructs it for a modern audience. It's even better than the original.

Much of Max Richter's music has been used on movies and he is currently composing the music used on HBO's [The Leftovers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQTgEdghAOA).

### Philip Glass

An obvious choice. The greatest composer today and one of the greatest of all time. The composer for every fantastic movie score including [The Hours](http://www.rdio.com/artist/Philip_Glass/album/The_Hours_%28Music_from_the_Motion_Picture_Soundtrack%29/) and [Notes on a Scandal](http://www.rdio.com/artist/Philip_Glass/album/Notes_on_a_Scandal_%28Original_Motion_Picture_Soundtrack%29/). Philip Glass is THE name to know if you are trying to get into classical music.

Although he currently discribes himself as a classicist musician, most will point to him as the father of minimalist classical music or music with a repetitive structure and other high-level music terms that you can read about [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_music). 

It's hard to pick a few pieces that are truly amazing as he has composed so much. But in 1998 he redid the score for the 1931 movie "Dracula" that is just amazing. The full movie with Philip Glass' new score can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwpCTYJpeNg) for free.
